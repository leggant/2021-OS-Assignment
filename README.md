When writing your README file, think about the reader as someone who does not know the
instructions provided in this document. Make sure to write the documentation for someone
who has limited knowledge of the Linux operating system. Additionally, think of yourself half
a year down the road, and what documentation you will need to understand the scripts you have
authored, how to run them, and what their purposes are.

NOTE: The other components of the formal aspects of this assignment (including error handling, code commenting and code modularity) are all assessed during review of your scripts for Task 1 and Task 2.
