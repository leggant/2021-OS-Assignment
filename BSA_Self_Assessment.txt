Script has a seperate function to handle the transfer of the file to the remote host machine. This has been tested, proven to work as required.

### Handling Script Input

[x] Completed 

Self-assessment Comments:
For the most part, all possible options have been accounted for and handled.  In task 1, I would have like to have added a function in the main menu to allow the user to enter an alternative URL or path to a csv file as a fall back rather than only offering this option if there was no local file available. 
Task 2, there is not as much input checking as I would have liked; every input is confirmed by the user. Some inputs should have included some regex checks on formatting/type of data values that are provided.

### Code Modularity

[x] Completed 

Self-assessment Comments:
All code is called from individual functions. Tried to give each function a single purpose, show a menu, parse a file, get an IP address etc

### Code Commenting

[o] Completed 

Self-assessment Comments:
Code was left under-commented if anything. I did add banner comments to section off blocks of functions related to a particular task
some functions got very long a difficult to follow, some comments have been added to these to help

### Git Usage

[x] Completed 

Self-assessment Comments:
Over 80 commits to the assignment repository. Some of these were needed in order to transfer code code developed on my PC to a VM for testing.
Commit messages could have been more descriptive about the changes made - mine were very generic.
